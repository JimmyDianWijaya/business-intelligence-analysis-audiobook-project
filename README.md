# Business Intelligence Analysis Project: Overview

The objective of this project is to gather 3 main insights about the performance of different audiobooks sold by a small audiobook retail store: 
1. The number of ratings (reviews) vs the average rating from February 2017 - February 2018. Is there a correlation between the two numerical variables? 
2. The percentage of reviews for each audiobook. Which audiobook has the highest and lowest % of reviews? 
3. The ratio between the number of reviews to the number of purchases from February 2017 - February 2018.

There were two datasets used to answer these business questions: Audiobook Reviews and Audiobook Sales from Feb 2017 - Feb 2018. 
Data cleansing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) were completed using Excel. 
Then, Tableau is employed to perform data blending and create a data dashboard to visualise the address the key insights of this project.
